  <h1>Privacy Policy for Paws Vs Claws</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> 02/14/2026</p>

  <p>
    Dumhawk (“we,” “us”) operates the mobile application Paws Vs Claws (the “App”).
    This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collected</h2>
  <p>
    We do not require an account and we do not directly collect personal information like your name,
    email, or address.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App shows advertisements using Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads). AdMob may automatically
    collect certain information to provide and measure ads, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device information (such as device type, OS version)</li>
    <li>IP address (which may be used to estimate general location)</li>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (such as IDFA, if you allow tracking on iOS)</li>
    <li>Information about ad interactions (e.g., which ads were shown, taps, and performance)</li>
    <li>Diagnostic data to help prevent fraud and ensure ad security</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Information Is Used</h2>
  <p>Information collected by AdMob may be used to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Display ads in the App</li>
    <li>Measure ad performance and improve ad relevance</li>
    <li>Limit how often you see the same ad (frequency capping)</li>
    <li>Detect, prevent, and address fraud or security issues</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tracking and Your Choices (iOS)</h2>
  <p>
    If the App requests permission to track you (App Tracking Transparency), you can choose
    <strong>Allow</strong> or <strong>Ask App Not to Track</strong>. You can change this anytime in iOS Settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on your settings and region, ads may be personalized or non-personalized.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads) for advertising</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    AdMob’s data practices are governed by Google’s own policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
    information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information,
    contact us at <a href="mailto:dumhawk@gmail.com">dumhawk@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the effective date above
    when changes are made.
